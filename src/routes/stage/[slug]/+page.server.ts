/*
    Hello code readers, (future me included, and any potential employers)
    This file is quite a mess, and I'm sorry for that.
    Due to time-constraints, this was the easiest way to get the page to work.
    There is a much better way to do this, and I will be doing that in the future,
    for the 1.0.0 release of this project. (Along with fixing the rest of the code).
    Do pardon the mess, and don't forget to wipe your feet before you leave.
